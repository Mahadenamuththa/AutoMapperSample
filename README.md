### What is AutoMapper?

AutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another. This type of code is rather dreary and boring to write, so why not invent a tool to do it for us?

This is the main repository for AutoMapper, but there's more:

* [EF6 Extensions](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.EF6)
* [IDataReader/Record Extensions](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.Data)
* [Collection Extensions](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.Collection)
* [Microsoft DI Extensions](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection)
* [Expression Mapping](https://github.com/AutoMapper/AutoMapper.Extensions.ExpressionMapping)
